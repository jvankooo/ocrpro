Business Profile 
 
Introduction 
 
Founded in 2017, Phable is a chronic disease management platform for chronic disease patients and healthcare 
providers. It is an ecosystem of medical devices, insurers, hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, labs, etc. focused on patient 
care access and experience. 
 
Its full stack technology platform is powered by a proprietary AI and ML that leverages patient data to provide real 
time interventions. In addition to doctor-patient engagement, its marketplace model captures healthcare spend by 
offering medical devices, medicines, subscription plans, etc. on its platform.  
 
Phable was founded by Sumit Sinha and Mukesh Bansal. Sumit is a second time entrepreneur (founded Kristys 
Kitchen which was later acquired by Cure.Fit at a premium) and has experience in tech, sales and consulting working 
at ICICI Bank, Deloitte, Borderless Access, etc. Mukesh has over 15 years of experience in tech working at 
organisations such as Kantar, Borderless Access, etc. Both founders had the idea of founding a digital healthcare 
platform after identifying significant gaps in their past experiences with the Indian healthcare infrastructure. 
 
The company has raised over ~INR 64 Cr from Kalaari Capital, Manipal Hospitals, Omron, etc. and is currently at an 
annualized GMV of ~INR 96 Cr.  
 
Problem Statement 
 
India suffers from a high level of chronic disease, with over 20% of the population suffering from chronic diseases 
(WHO, 2016 report). Additionally, more than 50% of deaths annually can be attributed to chronic illnesses. Due to 
this high incidence of non-communicable diseases, ~70% of all healthcare spend in India is on chronic diseases.  
 
Traditional systems of providing curative healthcare are not engagement centric, lack tech-enabled solutions and are 
reactive in nature. Moreover, due to lack of a single platform, data is stored in silos. The challenges can be 
summarized as follows: 
 
For Doctors: 
 
¾ Doctors need multiple technology platforms their practice and do not have access to a single platform for end-
to-end practice management and engagement. 
 
¾ There is a lack of data trail that can be leveraged to drive data-driven and outcome-based solutions. For 
example, prescriptions are issued on paper. 
 
¾ Doctors do not have the means to drive engagement and loyalty with patients. They find it difficult to keep 
track of patient progress. 
 
For Patients: 
 
¾ Manual tracking of progress and lack of means to improve adherence to disease management. 
 
¾ Lack of a single platform for access all healthcare needs and dependency of various sources. 
 
¾ High cost of healthcare due to lack of preventive measures and information asymmetry.

doctor engagement is free. However, the company generates revenue from any transactions made on the app 
(medicine delivery, appointment bookings, medical devices, subscriptions, etc.). 
 
In a span of a ~10 months, the company has reached a monthly GMV of ~INR 7.9 Cr. This is largely driven by 
medicine and device sales that account for ~75% of GMV in FY22 YTD. 
 
Revenue Streams 
 
Currently, the company has the following revenue streams: 
 
1. Medicine Sales: Phable has a B2B and a B2C business in medicine: 
 
¾ B2B Medicine Procurement: Phable provided a B2B procurement platform to pharmacies to procure 
medicine inventory directly from manufacturers and wholesalers. However, the contribution to GMV in 
insignificant (<2%) and the vertical will be discontinued in the coming months 
 
¾ B2C E-Pharmacy: Users can order medicines through the Phable app. The company has partnered with 
1mg and Pharmeasy to provide these services. However, the company is in the process of building in-
house capabilities by partnering with local pharmacies (pilot launched in Bangalore). 
 
2. Device Sales: Users can order medical devices such as glucometer, BP monitor, personal ECG device, etc. The 
company has partnered with Accu-Check, Omron (existing investor), Polar, etc. to distribute their products 
through the Phable app. These smart devices are targeted towards chronic disease patients and can be synced 
with the Phable app for real-time tracking by doctors. 
 
3. Subscriptions: Users can subscribe to healthcare plans. There are different plans available for different chronic

The chronic disease patients initially use Phable for ongoing engagement with their doctors, documenting health 
records, and monitoring their vitals through smart devices. This drives change in consumer behavior as users begin 
to transact on the app (medicines, lab bookings, consultations, etc.) in addition to using the app merely for doctor 
engagement and tracking. This changing consumer behavior is captured in the growing user base who are also 
transacting as well as the MoM increase in AOV. Since most patients are chronic disease patients, they require 
medical devices and specialized medicines due to which the AOV is high.

Corporate Vertical 
 
¾ Phable is building its corporate vertical to provide corporate health benefit plans targeted towards early-stage 
startups with an employee strength of 50-150 employees.  
 
¾ These health benefit plans will be a combination of health insurance and healthcare services that can be 
availed on the Phable app. In the near future, the company also plans to roll out healthcare credit cards for 
employees which would allow them to seamlessly avail 36-month healthcare loans. 
 
¾ Since its recent launch, Phable has onboarded 2 corporates including Ola. The company is in the process of 
hiring experienced senior professionals with a strong network of corporates to bolster its corporate 
partnerships.  
 
Doctors and Clinics 
 
Currently, Phable is focusing on adoption and acquiring patients through doctors. Therefore, the platform is free to 
use for doctors and focuses on overall clinic management and patient engagement. However, Phable plans to 
monetize doctor engagement by introducing products such as:  
 
¾ Doctor Consumables: Phable will serve as a procurement platform for doctors to procure consumables (surgical 
gloves, hospital wear, syringes, etc.) directly through the platform. 
 
¾ Advertising for Doctors: The Phable patient base is ~12 lakh users and growing. As the base continues to expand 
rapidly, doctors will be able to advertise their services on the Phable App to target patients. 
 
¾ SaaS and Data Tools: Phable will provide paid analytics and SaaS tools to doctors, clinics, and hospitals for e-
prescriptions, electronic medical records, tele-consultations, etc. The company has successfully completed its pilot 
and has deployed its SaaS tool for doctors across Fortis hospitals in South India.  
 
Strategic Partnerships 
 
Phable is bundling its subscription services with device manufacturers such as Omron, Accu-Check, etc. For example, 
Phable is rolling out its subscription services for all Omron users pan India. With every purchase of an Omron device,

Chronic Disease/ Non-Communicable Disease (NCDs) 
 
NCDs are one of the major challenges for public health in the 21st century, not only in terms of human suffering they 
cause but also the harm they inflict on the socioeconomic development of the country. NCDs kill approximately 41 
million people (71% of global deaths) worldwide each year, including 14 million people who die too young between 
the ages of 30 and 70. The majority of premature NCD deaths are preventable. 
 
According to WHO projections, the total annual number of deaths from NCDs will increase to 55 million by 2030, if 
timely interventions are not done for prevention and control of NCDs. 
 
In India, nearly 5.8 million people (WHO report, 2015) die from NCDs (heart and lung diseases, stroke, cancer and 
diabetes) every year or in other words 1 in 4 Indians has a risk of dying from an NCD before they reach the age of 70.

Unique Customer Acquisition Proposition 
Phable acquires users by partnering with doctors and clinics. For doctors, Phable serves as a free to use end-to-end 
clinic management platform for managing appointments, health records, tele-consultation, etc. which incentivizes 
doctors to adopt the platform. The doctors can monitor their patients through the Phable app by monitoring their 
progress, vitals, past health records, etc. while the patients use the app to store their medical records, vitals 
monitoring (through IoT connected medical devices). 
 
This helps in tapping into a large pool of chronic disease patients and drive engagement. By creating a By focusing on 
doctor adoption, the company has seen a strong network effect which can be seen in the consistent decrease in CAC 
from ~INR 240 per user to ~INR 40 per user.

India has the highest incidence of chronic diseases globally with 400 million Indians suffering from hypertension and 
diabetes. Consequently, 70% of all healthcare spend of $100B (INR 7.5 lakh Cr) in India is on chronic disease care. 
Chronic diseases require higher spend on specialised medication, devices for monitoring and disease management 
programs. By being the first healthcare platform to focus on CDM, Phable is in a strong position to create a strong 
digital healthcare network for these patients. The company has already created a strong network of providers across 
devices, insurance, medicines, etc. which would enable them to capture a large wallet share from these customers. 
The company has also shown a consistent increase in daily and weekly active users (~43k and ~30.9k respectively) 
and high retention of patients acquired through doctors (63% retention in users acquires 12 months ago).
