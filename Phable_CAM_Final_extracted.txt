The platform leverages AI and ML for real-time interventions. The company has raised significant funding and has a growing annualized GMV.  

Problem Statement: India has a high incidence of chronic diseases, with more than 50 percent of deaths attributed to non-communicable diseases. There is a lack of engagement-centric healthcare solutions, limited access to quality healthcare, and high costs due to lack of preventive measures.  

Phableâ€™s Solution: The platform provides a single platform for patients and doctors to manage bookings, consultations, prescriptions, and real-time patient tracking. It integrates transactions, data collection, and data-driven insights to improve healthcare outcomes.  

Revenue Streams: The company generates revenue through medicine sales, device sales, subscriptions, diagnostic labs, doctor consultations, health and wellness products, corporate wellness programs, and consumer insurance.  

GTM Strategy: Phable follows a B2B2C and B2C model for user acquisition. It partners with doctors and clinics to onboard patients and uses digital marketing to acquire users directly.  

Marketing and Discounting Strategy: The company is driving digital adoption through discounts and is transitioning towards a subscription model. It plans an extensive marketing campaign starting January 2022.  

Growth in Users: Phable has seen a steady increase in total users, monthly active users, and transacting users over time. The platform initially engages chronic disease patients for doctor consultations and record-keeping, which eventually drives transactions like medicine purchases, lab bookings, and device orders.  

Low Customer Acquisition Cost Due to Doctor Acquisition Channel: The company acquires patients primarily through doctors, creating a strong network effect. The cost of acquiring doctors and patients has dropped significantly over time while maintaining robust customer retention.  

User Retention: Phable has retained a significant percentage of users acquired through both digital and doctor channels. Users onboarded through doctors show even higher retention due to sustained engagement.  

Doctor Retention and Adoption Metrics: Over the past year, Phable has doubled its doctor base while maintaining a strong proportion of active doctors on the platform. The platform provides tools for managing bookings, teleconsultations, and patient monitoring, ensuring continued usage.  

Doctor Acquisition Strategy: Phable primarily acquires doctors through an on-ground sales team, which accounts for most acquisitions. Digital marketing also plays a role, but feet-on-street remains the dominant approach.  

Revenue Sharing Agreements with Partners: The company has agreements with partners like Pharmeasy, Omron, and Prima Diagnostics. Revenue-sharing terms vary, with commissions on completed orders, subscription margins, and payment cycles specified in agreements.  

Working Capital: Phable maintains minimal working capital. It holds a small inventory of fast-moving healthcare devices and has receivables from commissions, B2B medicine sales, and unbilled revenue. Payables primarily consist of dues to device manufacturers, corporate credit card providers, and diagnostic labs.  

Future Plans: Phable aims to expand its services and partnerships. Plans include offering post-hospitalization care, home healthcare services, and specialized diagnostic testing. The company is also developing corporate health benefit plans, combining insurance and healthcare services.  

Monetization Plans for Doctors: While currently free for doctors, Phable plans to introduce revenue-generating features like procurement of medical consumables, paid advertising for doctors, and premium SaaS tools for analytics and clinic management. The SaaS tool is already piloted across Fortis hospitals in South India.  

Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: Phable is collaborating with device manufacturers like Omron to bundle its subscription services with device purchases. The company also plans strategic acquisitions in chronic care management, health benefits platforms, financial planning for medical expenses, and electronic medical record solutions.  

Unit Economics: The company's revenue is derived from multiple streams, with device sales, medicine sales, doctor consultations, diagnostic labs, and health and wellness products contributing to the overall revenue. The company has operational costs that are semi-variable, such as salaries for operations teams.  

Industry Overview: Chronic diseases are a major healthcare challenge, accounting for a significant proportion of deaths worldwide. In India, millions suffer from conditions like hypertension and diabetes, leading to high healthcare expenditures.  

Challenges in Chronic Disease Management: Limited awareness about early symptoms leads to low diagnosis rates. Healthcare affordability is a major barrier, with insurance coverage being low and out-of-pocket expenses high. Patients also face challenges in accessing timely medical care due to constraints like time, distance, and lack of integrated platforms.  

Growth of eHealthcare in India: The eHealth market in India is expanding rapidly, covering telemedicine, epharmacy, and online fitness and wellness services. Telemedicine is the largest segment and is expected to continue growing, while epharmacy adoption is increasing due to better accessibility and affordability.  

Government Initiatives and Policy Support: The Indian government is actively promoting digital healthcare solutions. Telemedicine guidelines, electronic health record mandates, and national health initiatives are expected to drive further adoption of eHealth services.  

Emerging Trends in eHealth: The industry is seeing increased adoption of AI-powered healthcare solutions, remote healthcare insurance coverage, and integrated platform offerings. Digital transformation in healthcare is enabling better patient care and operational efficiency.
