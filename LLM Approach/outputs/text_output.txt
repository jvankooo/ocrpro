# Business Profile 

## Introduction

Founded in 2017, Phable is a chronic disease management platform for chronic disease patients and healthcare providers. It is an ecosystem of medical devices, insurers, hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, labs, etc. focused on patient care access and experience.

Its full stack technology platform is powered by a proprietary AI and ML that leverages patient data to provide real time interventions. In addition to doctor-patient engagement, its marketplace model captures healthcare spend by offering medical devices, medicines, subscription plans, etc. on its platform.

Phable was founded by Sumit Sinha and Mukesh Bansal. Sumit is a second time entrepreneur (founded Kristys Kitchen which was later acquired by Cure.Fit at a premium) and has experience in tech, sales and consulting working at ICICI Bank, Deloitte, Borderless Access, etc. Mukesh has over 15 years of experience in tech working at organisations such as Kantar, Borderless Access, etc. Both founders had the idea of founding a digital healthcare platform after identifying significant gaps in their past experiences with the Indian healthcare infrastructure.

The company has raised over $\sim$ INR 64 Cr from Kalaari Capital, Manipal Hospitals, Omron, etc. and is currently at an annualized GMV of $\sim$ INR 96 Cr .

## Problem Statement

India suffers from a high level of chronic disease, with over $20 \%$ of the population suffering from chronic diseases (WHO, 2016 report). Additionally, more than $50 \%$ of deaths annually can be attributed to chronic illnesses. Due to this high incidence of non-communicable diseases, $\sim 70 \%$ of all healthcare spend in India is on chronic diseases.

Traditional systems of providing curative healthcare are not engagement centric, lack tech-enabled solutions and are reactive in nature. Moreover, due to lack of a single platform, data is stored in silos. The challenges can be summarized as follows:

For Doctors:
$>$ Doctors need multiple technology platforms their practice and do not have access to a single platform for end-to-end practice management and engagement.
$>$ There is a lack of data trail that can be leveraged to drive data-driven and outcome-based solutions. For example, prescriptions are issued on paper.
$>$ Doctors do not have the means to drive engagement and loyalty with patients. They find it difficult to keep track of patient progress.

For Patients:
$>$ Manual tracking of progress and lack of means to improve adherence to disease management.
$>$ Lack of a single platform for access all healthcare needs and dependency of various sources.
$>$ High cost of healthcare due to lack of preventive measures and information asymmetry.

## Phable's Solution

================================================================================

Page 10:
Phable has built a full-stack two-sided technology platform for patients as well as doctors. For patients, it serves as a one-stop platform for doctor consultations, document digital health records, book lab tests, order medicines and devices, access disease specific content, and care management through alerts, reminders, etc. For doctors, it serves as a single platform for bookings management, document patient records and history, patient engagement, and realtime patient tracking.

Phable's platform has three layers - Transactions, Data, and Data-Driven Insights
![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

- Transactions: All healthcare related products and services for doctors (clinic management, billing, teleconsultations, etc.) and patients (medicines, devices, labs, tele-consultations, insurance, etc.).
- Data: Collecting static data (prescriptions, lab tests, etc.) through platform bookings and longitudinal data (biometrics, etc.) through IoT connected medical devices (third party).
- Data-Driven Insights: Targeted content, risk scoring, personalized therapy, and disease management by leveraging patient specific and clinical data.


# Business Overview 

FY21YTD Revenue Movement
![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

================================================================================

Page 11:
![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

Phable started monetizing recently in February'21. The app is currently free to use for doctors. Similarly, patientdoctor engagement is free. However, the company generates revenue from any transactions made on the app (medicine delivery, appointment bookings, medical devices, subscriptions, etc.).

In a span of a $\sim 10$ months, the company has reached a monthly GMV of $\sim$ INR 7.9 Cr . This is largely driven by medicine and device sales that account for $\sim 75 \%$ of GMV in FY22 YTD.

# Revenue Streams 

Currently, the company has the following revenue streams:

1. Medicine Sales: Phable has a B2B and a B2C business in medicine:
> B2B Medicine Procurement: Phable provided a B2B procurement platform to pharmacies to procure medicine inventory directly from manufacturers and wholesalers. However, the contribution to GMV in insignificant $(<2 \%)$ and the vertical will be discontinued in the coming months
> B2C E-Pharmacy: Users can order medicines through the Phable app. The company has partnered with 1 mg and Pharmeasy to provide these services. However, the company is in the process of building inhouse capabilities by partnering with local pharmacies (pilot launched in Bangalore).
2. Device Sales: Users can order medical devices such as glucometer, BP monitor, personal ECG device, etc. The company has partnered with Accu-Check, Omron (existing investor), Polar, etc. to distribute their products through the Phable app. These smart devices are targeted towards chronic disease patients and can be synced with the Phable app for real-time tracking by doctors.
3. Subscriptions: Users can subscribe to healthcare plans. There are different plans available for different chronic diseases, usually a combination of a device paired with other services. For example, the 'Diabetes Care Package' includes a glucometer, diabetes expert assessment, unlimited doctor consultations, personalized fitness sessions, etc.
4. Diagnostic Labs: Users can book diagnostic tests. The company has partnered with diagnostic labs such as SRL Diagnostics, Thyrocare, Healthians, etc. to provide these services.
5. Doctor Consultations: Users can book appointments or tele-consultations with partner doctors.
6. Health and Wellness: Users can buy healthy food supplements and has partnered with brands such as True Elements that offers healthy breakfast options and snacks.
7. Corporate Wellness: Phable has started partnering with corporates to provide comprehensive corporate wellness plans to its employees.
8. Consumer Insurance: Phable has partnered with Care Insurance to provide insurance plans to users. The plans include health insurance from Care coupled with services offered by Phable such as doctor consultations, health management programs, discounts on lab tests, etc.

# GTM Strategy 

The company follows a B2B2C and B2C model for user acquisition:

- B2B2C model: Phable acquires users by partnering with doctors and clinics. For doctors, Phable serves as a free to use end-to-end clinic management platform for managing appointments, health records, tele-consultations, etc. which incentivizes doctors to adopt the platform. After partnering with doctors, all patients are encouraged to use the Phable app for future engagement with the doctors. The doctors can monitor the patients' vitals in real time through IoT devices connected to the Phable app. This acquisition channel leads to high adoption and retention on the platform. $\sim 60 \%$ of users are acquired through this channel.
- B2C model: Phable utilizes digital marketing tools to acquire users directly. Most used channels of marketing are social platforms such as Facebook, Google, etc. $\sim 30 \%$ of users are acquired through this channel. ( $10 \%$ of users are through organic downloads).


## Marketing and Discounting Strategy

Phable is focusing on driving change in consumer behavior by incentivizing patients to transact digitally. The platform is offering deep discounts for user acquisition and mostly retention. The platform, however, is moving towards a subscription model wherein users will pay a minimal monthly fee to avail discounted services.

Starting January'22, the company is planning an extensive 15 month marketing campaign across traditional and print media. $\rightarrow$ Unit is the budat?

| Transacting users <br> (\% of MAU) | $4 \%$ | $4 \%$ | $3 \%$ | $3 \%$ | $4 \%$ |

Note: Monthly active users are defined as users having at least one session on the app per month.

# Number of Transactions and AOV Chart MoM 

![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)

The chronic disease patients initially use Phable for ongoing engagement with their doctors, documenting health records, and monitoring their vitals through smart devices. This drives change in consumer behavior as users begin to transact on the app (medicines, lab bookings, consultations, etc.) in addition to using the app merely for doctor engagement and tracking. This changing consumer behavior is captured in the growing user base who are also transacting as well as the MoM increase in AOV. Since most patients are chronic disease patients, they require medical devices and specialized medicines due to which the AOV is high.

# Low Customer CAC due to Doctor Acquisition Channel 

Acquiring patients through doctors have created a strong network effect amongst patients and the doctor community alike. This customer acquisition approach has led to consistent drop in CAC across doctors and patients:

# Future Plans 

As the dependency and adoption by doctors and patients increases, Phable will look to introduce new services and focus on more strategic partnerships to become a one stop platform for both, doctors as well as patients.

## Patients

- Retail Vertical

Phable has plans to increase its offering and bolster existing ones by introducing services such as:
> Post IPD services for post-surgery care including consultation, insurance claim processing, etc.

================================================================================

Page 21:
$>$ At home healthcare services including doctor, nurse, and physio on demand
$>$ Specialized testing including genetic testing (gut microbiome, etc.)

- Corporate Vertical
$>$ Phable is building its corporate vertical to provide corporate health benefit plans targeted towards early-stage startups with an employee strength of 50-150 employees.
$>$ These health benefit plans will be a combination of health insurance and healthcare services that can be availed on the Phable app. In the near future, the company also plans to roll out healthcare credit cards for employees which would allow them to seamlessly avail 36-month healthcare loans.
$>$ Since its recent launch, Phable has onboarded 2 corporates including Ola. The company is in the process of hiring experienced senior professionals with a strong network of corporates to bolster its corporate partnerships.


# Doctors and Clinics 

Currently, Phable is focusing on adoption and acquiring patients through doctors. Therefore, the platform is free to use for doctors and focuses on overall clinic management and patient engagement. However, Phable plans to monetize doctor engagement by introducing products such as:
$>$ Doctor Consumables: Phable will serve as a procurement platform for doctors to procure consumables (surgical gloves, hospital wear, syringes, etc.) directly through the platform.
$>$ Advertising for Doctors: The Phable patient base is $\sim 12$ lakh users and growing. As the base continues to expand rapidly, doctors will be able to advertise their services on the Phable App to target patients.
$>$ SaaS and Data Tools: Phable will provide paid analytics and SaaS tools to doctors, clinics, and hospitals for eprescriptions, electronic medical records, tele-consultations, etc. The company has successfully completed its pilot and has deployed its SaaS tool for doctors across Fortis hospitals in South India.

## Strategic Partnerships

Phable is bundling its subscription services with device manufacturers such as Omron, Accu-Check, etc. For example, Phable is rolling out its subscription services for all Omron users pan India. With every purchase of an Omron device, there will be a QR code on the product to access Phable's subscription plans. These would be at discounted rates and free of cost for a fixed period after which the users can get it renewed for a fee.

# About Industry 

## Chronic Disease/ Non-Communicable Disease (NCDs)

NCDs are one of the major challenges for public health in the 21st century, not only in terms of human suffering they cause but also the harm they inflict on the socioeconomic development of the country. NCDs kill approximately 41 million people ( $71 \%$ of global deaths) worldwide each year, including 14 million people who die too young between the ages of 30 and 70 . The majority of premature NCD deaths are preventable.

According to WHO projections, the total annual number of deaths from NCDs will increase to 55 million by 2030, if timely interventions are not done for prevention and control of NCDs.

In India, nearly 5.8 million people (WHO report, 2015) die from NCDs (heart and lung diseases, stroke, cancer and diabetes) every year or in other words 1 in 4 Indians has a risk of dying from an NCD before they reach the age of 70.

## Current Chronic Disease Management in India

(1) Awareness: There is very limited understanding of early symptoms of chronic diseases, leading to low diagnosis rates. Chronic patients generally blame their genes for their state, and are not aware that a lifestyle disorder can be conquered easily with small incremental interventions

================================================================================

(2) Affordability: Healthcare is under-served and under-consumed in India because of a huge affordability barrier. Insurance covers less than a fifth of our population, and out-of-pocket spending is considerably high. Moreover, health insurance covers only inpatient (hospitalization) costs and completely excludes outpatient (doctor visit) costs leading to breaks in treatment.

(3) Access: Very often patients miss their doctor follow-ups. Urban patients are constrained by time and non-urban patients by distance limiting access to the doctor

eHealthcare in India
Improved access to healthcare providers, enhanced productivity and lower healthcare costs has accelerated the penetration of eHealth in India which mainly includes the following segments - telemedicine, epharmacy, online fitness and wellness. In 2020, the size of the eHealth market is $\sim \$ 2$ bn (INR 14,850Cr). The market is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of $\sim 40 \%$ and reach $\sim \$ 10$ bn (INR 74,200Cr) in size between 2020 and 2025.
![img-22.jpeg](img-22.jpeg)

- Telemedicine is the largest contributor to the market, contributing over $50 \%$ in 2020. The market is expected to reach $\sim$ INR 38,000 cr by 2025 growing at rate of $\sim 22 \%$.
- Epharmacy, although at a nascent stage, is expected to grow exponentially to reach $\sim$ INR 30,000 cr by 2025.
- The Online Fitness and Wellness segment is underpenetrated and is expected to reach $\sim$ INR 7,000 cr by 2025.

# Total Addressable Market 

> Indian spends \$100B (INR 7,50,000 Cr) per annum out-of-pocket on their health. 70\% of all healthcare spend in India is on Chronic Disease. (Source: National Health Mission Report 'Household Health Expenditures' 2014)
![img-24.jpeg](img-24.jpeg)
> 400 million Indians suffer from Hypertension and Diabetes. There is $\sim 50 \%$ penetration of smartphones in India, out of which $65 \%$ of these smartphones have OS which can support eHealthcare apps. Thus, 70 million ( 400 million * $50 \%$ * $65 \%$ ) people are the immediate Total Addressable Market (by Volume).

================================================================================

Page 27:
$>$ These 70 million people are typically spending INR 50,000 per annum on managing their ailment. Thus, INR 3,50,000 Cr ( 70 million * INR 50,000) is the immediate Total Addressable Market by value.

eHealth Value Proposition
Telemedicine
$>$ Easier access to specialists at the patient's convenience through
$>$ Access to quality healthcare in tier 2 and tier 3 cities
$>$ Consumer reviews and ratings on the app
$>$ Integrated offerings through a single platform
$>$ Maintaining electronic health records (EHR) for better decision making and outcome based patient care

# Epharmacy 

$>$ Access to higher variety
$>$ Competitive prices and subscription-based models
$>$ Doorstep delivery with rescheduling option and cold-chain management
$>$ Online in-app support

## Key Growth Enablers

$>$ Consumer Behaviour: One of the key enablers for the growth in teleconsulting in India is the emergence of new consumer behavior of digital consumption. Rapid uptake of tele consultation is driven by young population accustomed to the app culture. With more smartphones having access to health apps, digital technology has the potential to transform and enable delivery of virtual health care in a more convenient and effective manner.
$>$ Demography and Disease Mix: India's changing demographics with elderly population expected to be $20 \%$ of total population in 2050 as compared to $8 \%$ in 2015 and the increasing incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases also strengthens the increasing adoption of tele consultation in the times to come. India has the second highest number of diabetes cases in the world and $28 \%$ deaths occur due to heart diseases.
$>$ COVID19 Impact: The COVID19 pandemic has led to massive expansion of tele-consulting and other eHealth services as doctors and patients are restricted to interact in person.

================================================================================

> Policy and Regulatory Landscape: The Indian healthcare system is embracing digital technologies to fix healthcare system-level constraints to increase its accessibility and enhance its affordability. With the release of the telemedicine guidelines in March 2020 the Medical Council of India (MCI) has further confirmed the growing need for teleconsultation. Similarly, Digital health records are likely to be mandated soon with the advent of Ayushman Bharat, the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and Employees' State Insurance (ESI). The Niti Aayog has set up a National Health Stack (NHS) to build a digital health system and onboard medical device makers, tele-medicine service providers, professional care service providers, and digital healthcare systems providers.
$>$ Government Initiatives: The Government of India is taking immediate action and targeting the greatest risk factors contributing to NCDs, namely unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco and alcohol use and air pollution. In line with WHO's Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013-2020, India is the first country to develop specific national targets and indicators aimed at reducing the number of global premature deaths from NCDs by $25 \%$ by 2025. A National Multisectoral Action Plan that outlines actions by various sectors in addition to the health sector, to reduce the burden of NCDs and their risk factors, is in the final stage of development

# eHealth Emerging Trends 

$>$ Use of AI Integrated Software: Healthcare service providers are implementing AI-based software for a wide range of purposes, from determining skin cancer from images to detecting pulmonary nodules and x-rays. Such software can be used to decide the next steps or the best set of questions that can be asked to the patient based on the acquired data and insights. A strong digital infrastructure with IoT integration across personal devices, hospital and public healthcare databases is helping spur efficient growth
$>$ Remote Healthcare Insurance Coverage: There is an increase in insurance coverage for remote healthcare services and remote monitoring by insurance companies and government-administered programs, especially since the pandemic. This would reduce healthcare costs and ensure healthcare even in adverse situations.
$>$ Integrated Platform Offering: eHealth players have been focusing on diversifying their offerings by integrating a suite of other healthcare services including telemedicine services, online diagnostics, and other related services. Therefore, a single platform can become a 'one-stop' solution for all healthcare related services. There has even created a deluge of patient-related data, and doctors can decide on how to advise or treat those patients timely and efficiently.

Risk and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
| :--: | :--: |
| High burn and no clear path to profitability <br> On a monthly GMV of $\sim$ INR 8 Cr , the company has a monthly burn of $\sim$ INR 6.8 Cr (Oct'21) due to discounts and customer acquisition costs | $>$ Phable is focusing strongly on customer acquisition and retention which has resulted in a high monthly burn of $\sim$ INR 6.7 Cr . However, the company is adding over 1.5 lakh users each month and has added $\sim 6$ lakh users in the last 6 month through a successful customer acquisition and marketing strategy. <br> Phable is raising $\$ 17 \mathrm{Mn}$ ins series B with infusion expected in Dec'21. Furthermore, the company is in advanced discussions to raise a $\$ 80-\$ 100 \mathrm{Mn}$ round in Q4FY22/FY23. This would allow the company to sustain its P\&L burn comfortably |
| No clear product market fit <br> Phable has started monetizing recently in Feb'21 and currently has multiple lines of revenue with no clear product market fit | $>$ Phable is creating a niche in the chronic disease management segment by the being the first HealthTech player to focus on this space. The company is leveraging a unique acquisition model to drive customer as well as doctor engagement and is in a strong position to be a one stop solution for all healthcare needs of chronic disease patients. <br> The company is building a suite of services targeted towards the ecosystem of doctors, clinics, and chronic disease patients. Therefore, the potential to be highly sticky and to acquire a larger wallet share of the entire ecosystem is high. |
| Investor quality and scalability <br> The current investors lack the appetite to lead future rounds of equity in the business | $>$ Phable is raising $\$ 17 \mathrm{Mn}$ in December from new investor Aflac Ventures ( $\$ 400 \mathrm{Mn}$ international fund) and is in advanced discussions to raise a larger equity round in the range of $\$ 80-100 \mathrm{Mn}$. In the subsequent round, the company is seeing significant interest from large VCs. This would give them access to a larger pool of capital to fund |

# Rationale for Recommendation 

## Debt Protection

Phable is raising $\$ 17 \mathrm{mn}$ ( INR 125 Cr ) in equity led by Kalaari ( $\$ 7 \mathrm{Mn}$ ) and Aflac Ventures ( $\$ 5 \mathrm{Mn}$ ) with participation from Omron and Manipal Hospitals with infusion. The company currently has INR 20 Cr in cash and cash equivalents and the equity infusion is expected in December'21. Additionally, the company is in advanced discussions to raise $\sim \$ 80-\$ 100 \mathrm{Mn}$ from new and existing investors with the closure expected in Q4 FY22. Stride's facility is split into two tranches of INR 10 Cr (T1) and INR 25 Cr (T2). T1 will be disbursed pre-equity infusion while T 2 will be disbursed along with the $\$ 17 \mathrm{Mn}$ equity infusion.

## Quality Founders and Experienced Team

Both founders have experience across product, finance and engineering. They have worked at organisations such as Sumit is a second time entrepreneur who founded Kristy's kitchen, a foodtech startup, which was later acquired by Cure.Fit at a premium. The founders have 10+ years of experience working at organisations such as Kantar, Borderless Access, Deloitte, etc.

Phable has built a robust team of KMPs hiring experienced personnel from Healthcare, Consumer, IT, and Finance from organisations such as Apollo, Practo, Asia Healthcare, Cisco, Byju's, Asian Paints, etc.

## Unique Customer Acquisition Proposition

Phable acquires users by partnering with doctors and clinics. For doctors, Phable serves as a free to use end-to-end clinic management platform for managing appointments, health records, tele-consultation, etc. which incentivizes doctors to adopt the platform. The doctors can monitor their patients through the Phable app by monitoring their progress, vitals, past health records, etc. while the patients use the app to store their medical records, vitals monitoring (through IoT connected medical devices).

This helps in tapping into a large pool of chronic disease patients and drive engagement. By creating a By focusing on doctor adoption, the company has seen a strong network effect which can be seen in the consistent decrease in CAC from $\sim$ INR 240 per user to $\sim$ INR 40 per user.

## Large TAM and Sticky Customer Base

India has the highest incidence of chronic diseases globally with 400 million Indians suffering from hypertension and diabetes. Consequently, $70 \%$ of all healthcare spend of $\$ 100 \mathrm{~B}$ (INR 7.5 lakh Cr ) in India is on chronic disease care. Chronic diseases require higher spend on specialised medication, devices for monitoring and disease management programs. By being the first healthcare platform to focus on CDM, Phable is in a strong position to create a strong digital healthcare network for these patients. The company has already created a strong network of providers across devices, insurance, medicines, etc. which would enable them to capture a large wallet share from these customers.

The company has also shown a consistent increase in daily and weekly active users ( $\sim 43 \mathrm{k}$ and $\sim 30.9 \mathrm{k}$ respectively) and high retention of patients acquired through doctors ( $63 \%$ retention in users acquires 12 months ago).

Furthermore, the company is building products for doctors and clinics, in addition to patients, who are already on the platform and has over 4,000 active doctors using Phable already.

# Reference Checks 

## Saurabh Pandey, CEO and Co-founder, Akna Medical (Now Pharmeasy)

"Chronic care is a very sticky segment and traditionally, the supply chain for medicines, quality lab tests and doctors has been found missing in India. There are multiple new age digital solutions that have been built in this space over the last 4-5 years and it was only a matter of time before a digital healthcare platform was born connecting the entire ecosystem. At Pharmeasy as well, we will look towards this segment through means of organic or inorganic expansion but Phable currently stands to obtain a firstmover advantage"

## Ramesh Kannan, Partner, Somerset Indus Healthcare Fund

"Telemedicine on a standalone basis is not profitable and may not be on a steady state basis either. The only profitable segments can be surgery and Lab tests (Diagnostics). Chronic care management systems in India are currently broken in India and hence, a connected health system can go a long way to solving the problem of disconnection between a doctor and a chronic patient.Due to a raise in ticket sizes and the risk at hand (life), such a digital model has a good chance of showing profitability in the steady state."
