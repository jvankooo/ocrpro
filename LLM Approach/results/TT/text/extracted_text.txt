Business Profile 
 
Introduction 
 
Founded in 2017, Phable is a chronic disease management platform for chronic disease patients and healthcare 
providers. It is an ecosystem of medical devices, insurers, hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, labs, etc. focused on patient 
care access and experience. 
 
Its full stack technology platform is powered by a proprietary AI and ML that leverages patient data to provide real 
time interventions. In addition to doctor-patient engagement, its marketplace model captures healthcare spend by 
offering medical devices, medicines, subscription plans, etc. on its platform.  
 
Phable was founded by Sumit Sinha and Mukesh Bansal. Sumit is a second time entrepreneur (founded Kristys 
Kitchen which was later acquired by Cure.Fit at a premium) and has experience in tech, sales and consulting working 
at ICICI Bank, Deloitte, Borderless Access, etc. Mukesh has over 15 years of experience in tech working at 
organisations such as Kantar, Borderless Access, etc. Both founders had the idea of founding a digital healthcare 
platform after identifying significant gaps in their past experiences with the Indian healthcare infrastructure. 
 
The company has raised over ~INR 64 Cr from Kalaari Capital, Manipal Hospitals, Omron, etc. and is currently at an 
annualized GMV of ~INR 96 Cr.  
 
Problem Statement 
 
India suffers from a high level of chronic disease, with over 20% of the population suffering from chronic diseases 
(WHO, 2016 report). Additionally, more than 50% of deaths annually can be attributed to chronic illnesses. Due to 
this high incidence of non-communicable diseases, ~70% of all healthcare spend in India is on chronic diseases.  
 
Traditional systems of providing curative healthcare are not engagement centric, lack tech-enabled solutions and are 
reactive in nature. Moreover, due to lack of a single platform, data is stored in silos. The challenges can be 
summarized as follows: 
 
For Doctors: 
 
¾ Doctors need multiple technology platforms their practice and do not have access to a single platform for end-
to-end practice management and engagement. 
 
¾ There is a lack of data trail that can be leveraged to drive data-driven and outcome-based solutions. For 
example, prescriptions are issued on paper. 
 
¾ Doctors do not have the means to drive engagement and loyalty with patients. They find it difficult to keep 
track of patient progress. 
 
For Patients: 
 
¾ Manual tracking of progress and lack of means to improve adherence to disease management. 
 
¾ Lack of a single platform for access all healthcare needs and dependency of various sources. 
 
¾ High cost of healthcare due to lack of preventive measures and information asymmetry.

Phable has built a full-stack two-sided technology platform for patients as well as doctors. For patients, it serves as a 
one-stop platform for doctor consultations, document digital health records, book lab tests, order medicines and 
devices, access disease specific content, and care management through alerts, reminders, etc. For doctors, it serves as 
a single platform for bookings management, document patient records and history, patient engagement, and real-
time patient tracking.

doctor engagement is free. However, the company generates revenue from any transactions made on the app 
(medicine delivery, appointment bookings, medical devices, subscriptions, etc.). 
 
In a span of a ~10 months, the company has reached a monthly GMV of ~INR 7.9 Cr. This is largely driven by 
medicine and device sales that account for ~75% of GMV in FY22 YTD. 
 
Revenue Streams 
 
Currently, the company has the following revenue streams: 
 
1. Medicine Sales: Phable has a B2B and a B2C business in medicine: 
 
¾ B2B Medicine Procurement: Phable provided a B2B procurement platform to pharmacies to procure 
medicine inventory directly from manufacturers and wholesalers. However, the contribution to GMV in 
insignificant (<2%) and the vertical will be discontinued in the coming months 
 
¾ B2C E-Pharmacy: Users can order medicines through the Phable app. The company has partnered with 
1mg and Pharmeasy to provide these services. However, the company is in the process of building in-
house capabilities by partnering with local pharmacies (pilot launched in Bangalore). 
 
2. Device Sales: Users can order medical devices such as glucometer, BP monitor, personal ECG device, etc. The 
company has partnered with Accu-Check, Omron (existing investor), Polar, etc. to distribute their products

with the Phable app for real-time tracking by doctors. 
 
3. Subscriptions: Users can subscribe to healthcare plans. There are different plans available for different chronic

GTM Strategy 
 
The company follows a B2B2C and B2C model for user acquisition: 
 
x 
B2B2C model: Phable acquires users by partnering with doctors and clinics. For doctors, Phable serves as a free to 
use end-to-end clinic management platform for managing appointments, health records, tele-consultations, etc. 
which incentivizes doctors to adopt the platform. After partnering with doctors, all patients are encouraged to use 
the Phable app for future engagement with the doctors. 7KHGRFWRUVFDQPRQLWRUWKHSDWLHQWV·YLWDOVLQUHDOWLPH
through IoT devices connected to the Phable app. This acquisition channel leads to high adoption and retention 
on the platform. ~60% of users are acquired through this channel.  
 
x 
B2C model: Phable utilizes digital marketing tools  to acquire users directly. Most used channels of marketing are 
social platforms such as Facebook, Google, etc.  ~30% of users are acquired through this channel. (10% of users 
are through organic downloads). 
 
 
Marketing and Discounting Strategy 
 
Phable is focusing on driving change in consumer behavior by incentivizing patients to transact digitally. The 
platform is offering deep discounts for user acquisition and mostly retention. The platform, however, is moving 
towards a subscription model wherein users will pay a minimal monthly fee to avail discounted services.

Number of Transactions and AOV Chart MoM 
 
 
The chronic disease patients initially use Phable for ongoing engagement with their doctors, documenting health 
records, and monitoring their vitals through smart devices. This drives change in consumer behavior as users begin 
to transact on the app (medicines, lab bookings, consultations, etc.) in addition to using the app merely for doctor 
engagement and tracking. This changing consumer behavior is captured in the growing user base who are also 
transacting as well as the MoM increase in AOV. Since most patients are chronic disease patients, they require 
medical devices and specialized medicines due to which the AOV is high.

Low Customer CAC due to Doctor Acquisition Channel 
 
Acquiring patients through doctors have created a strong network effect amongst patients and the doctor community 
alike. This customer acquisition approach has led to consistent drop in CAC across doctors and patients:

Doctor Acquisition Strategy 
 
The platform relies on doctor partnerships to acquire customers and has ~6,400 doctor partners on its platform. 
Doctors are acquired mostly through an on-ground sales team (feet on street) and through digital marketing. 
However, feet on street continues to be the dominant source of acquisition for doctors (85-90% acquisitions). With 
higher acceptability and scale in business, Phable has acquired ~3,300 doctors in the last 12 months

Future Plans 
 
As the dependency and adoption by doctors and patients increases, Phable will look to introduce new services and 
focus on more strategic partnerships to become a one stop platform for both, doctors as well as patients.  
 
Patients 
 
x 
Retail Vertical 
 
Phable has plans to increase its offering and bolster existing ones by introducing services such as: 
 
¾ Post IPD services for post-surgery care including consultation, insurance claim processing, etc.  


     
                                             
 
21 
 
¾ At home healthcare services including doctor, nurse, and physio on demand 
¾ Specialized testing including genetic testing (gut microbiome, etc.) 
 
x 
Corporate Vertical 
 
¾ Phable is building its corporate vertical to provide corporate health benefit plans targeted towards early-stage 
startups with an employee strength of 50-150 employees.  
 
¾ These health benefit plans will be a combination of health insurance and healthcare services that can be 
availed on the Phable app. In the near future, the company also plans to roll out healthcare credit cards for 
employees which would allow them to seamlessly avail 36-month healthcare loans. 
 
¾ Since its recent launch, Phable has onboarded 2 corporates including Ola. The company is in the process of 
hiring experienced senior professionals with a strong network of corporates to bolster its corporate 
partnerships.  
 
Doctors and Clinics 
 
Currently, Phable is focusing on adoption and acquiring patients through doctors. Therefore, the platform is free to 
use for doctors and focuses on overall clinic management and patient engagement. However, Phable plans to 
monetize doctor engagement by introducing products such as:  
 
¾ Doctor Consumables: Phable will serve as a procurement platform for doctors to procure consumables (surgical 
gloves, hospital wear, syringes, etc.) directly through the platform. 
 
¾ Advertising for Doctors: The Phable patient base is ~12 lakh users and growing. As the base continues to expand 
rapidly, doctors will be able to advertise their services on the Phable App to target patients. 
 
¾ SaaS and Data Tools: Phable will provide paid analytics and SaaS tools to doctors, clinics, and hospitals for e-
prescriptions, electronic medical records, tele-consultations, etc. The company has successfully completed its pilot 
and has deployed its SaaS tool for doctors across Fortis hospitals in South India.  
 
Strategic Partnerships 
 
Phable is bundling its subscription services with device manufacturers such as Omron, Accu-Check, etc. For example, 
Phable is rolling out its subscription services for all Omron users pan India. With every purchase of an Omron device,

About Industry 
 
Chronic Disease/ Non-Communicable Disease (NCDs) 
 
NCDs are one of the major challenges for public health in the 21st century, not only in terms of human suffering they 
cause but also the harm they inflict on the socioeconomic development of the country. NCDs kill approximately 41 
million people (71% of global deaths) worldwide each year, including 14 million people who die too young between 
the ages of 30 and 70. The majority of premature NCD deaths are preventable. 
 
According to WHO projections, the total annual number of deaths from NCDs will increase to 55 million by 2030, if 
timely interventions are not done for prevention and control of NCDs. 
 
In India, nearly 5.8 million people (WHO report, 2015) die from NCDs (heart and lung diseases, stroke, cancer and 
diabetes) every year or in other words 1 in 4 Indians has a risk of dying from an NCD before they reach the age of 70.

Current Chronic Disease Management in India 
 
(1) Awareness: There is very limited understanding of early symptoms of chronic diseases, leading to low 
diagnosis rates. Chronic patients generally blame their genes for their state, and are not aware that a lifestyle 
disorder can be conquered easily with small incremental interventions

Source: NATHEALTH, 2015 
 
(2) Affordability: Healthcare is under-served and under-consumed in India because of a huge affordability barrier. 
Insurance covers less than a fifth of our population, and out-of-pocket spending is considerably high. Moreover, 
health insurance covers only inpatient (hospitalization) costs and completely excludes outpatient (doctor visit) 
costs leading to breaks in treatment.

(3) Access: Very often patients miss their doctor follow-ups. Urban patients are constrained by time and non-urban 
patients by distance limiting access to the doctor

Key Growth Enablers 
 
¾ Consumer Behaviour: One of the key enablers for the growth in teleconsulting in India is the emergence of new 
consumer behavior of digital consumption. Rapid uptake of tele consultation is driven by young population 
accustomed to the app culture. With more smartphones having access to health apps, digital technology has the 
potential to transform and enable delivery of virtual health care in a more convenient and effective manner.  
 
¾ Demography and Disease Mix: ,QGLD·VFKDQJLQJGHPRJUDSKLFVZLWKHOGHUO\SRSXODWLRQH[SHFWHGWREe 20% of 
total population in 2050 as compared to 8% in 2015 and the increasing incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases 
also strengthens the increasing adoption of tele consultation in the times to come. India has the second highest 
number of diabetes cases in the world and 28% deaths occur due to heart diseases. 
 
¾ COVID19 Impact: The COVID19 pandemic has led to massive expansion of tele-consulting and other eHealth 
services as doctors and patients are restricted to interact in person.

¾ Policy and Regulatory Landscape: The Indian healthcare system is embracing digital technologies to fix 
healthcare system-level constraints to increase its accessibility and enhance its affordability. With the release 
of the telemedicine guidelines in March 2020 the Medical Council of India (MCI) has further confirmed the 
growing need for teleconsultation. Similarly, Digital health records are likely to be mandated soon with the 
advent of Ayushman Bharat, the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and Employees' State Insurance 
(ESI). The Niti Aayog has set up a National Health Stack (NHS) to build a digital health system and onboard 
medical device makers, tele²medicine service providers, professional care service providers, and digital 
healthcare systems providers. 
 
¾ Government Initiatives: The Government of India is taking immediate action and targeting the greatest risk 
factors contributing to NCDs, namely unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco and alcohol use and air 
SROOXWLRQ,QOLQHZLWK:+2·V*OREDODFWLRQ plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013-2020, India is 
the first country to develop specific national targets and indicators aimed at reducing the number of global 
premature deaths from NCDs by 25% by 2025. A National Multisectoral Action Plan that outlines actions by 
various sectors in addition to the health sector, to reduce the burden of NCDs and their risk factors, is in the 
final stage of development 
 
eHealth Emerging Trends  
 
¾ Use of AI Integrated Software: Healthcare service providers are implementing AI-based software for a wide 
range of purposes, from determining skin cancer from images to detecting pulmonary nodules and x-rays. 
Such software can be used to decide the next steps or the best set of questions that can be asked to the patient 
based on the acquired data and insights. A strong digital infrastructure with IoT integration across personal 
devices, hospital and public healthcare databases is helping spur efficient growth 
 
¾ Remote Healthcare Insurance Coverage: There is an increase in insurance coverage for remote healthcare 
services and remote monitoring by insurance companies and government-administered programs, especially 
since the pandemic. This would reduce healthcare costs and ensure healthcare even in adverse situations. 
 
¾ Integrated Platform Offering: eHealth players have been focusing on diversifying their offerings by 
integrating a suite of other healthcare services including telemedicine services, online diagnostics, and other 
UHODWHGVHUYLFHV7KHUHIRUHDVLQJOHSODWIRUPFDQEHFRPHD¶RQH-VWRS·VROution for all healthcare related 
services. There has even created a deluge of patient-related data, and doctors can decide on how to advise or 
treat those patients timely and efficiently.

¾ Combining Brick-and-Mortar with Technology: With tier 2 and tier 3 cities facing shortages of primary care, 
brick-and-mortar health centres equipped with technology can bridge the service gaps. This has proven 
effective in delivering digital healthcare services to the underserved.

High burn and no clear path to profitability 
 
On a monthly GMV of ~INR 8 Cr, the 
company has a monthly burn of ~INR 6.8 Cr 
2FW·due to discounts and customer 
acquisition costs 
 
 
¾ Phable is focusing strongly on customer acquisition 
and retention which has resulted in a high monthly 
burn of ~INR 6.7 Cr. However, the company is adding 
over 1.5 lakh users each month and has added ~6 lakh

¾ Phable is creating a niche in the chronic disease 
management segment by the being the first 
HealthTech player to focus on this space. The 
company is leveraging a unique acquisition model to 
drive customer as well as doctor engagement and is in 
a strong position to be a one stop solution for all 
healthcare needs of chronic disease patients. 
 
¾ The company is building a suite of services targeted 
towards the ecosystem of doctors, clinics, and chronic 
disease patients.  Therefore, the potential to be highly 
sticky and to acquire a larger wallet share of the entire 
ecosystem is high.  
 
 
Investor quality and scalability 
 
The current investors lack the appetite to lead 
future rounds of equity in the business 
 
 
¾ Phable is raising $17 Mn in December from new 
investor Aflac Ventures ($400 Mn international 
fund) and is in advanced discussions to raise a 
larger equity round in the range of  $80-100 Mn. In 
the subsequent round, the company is seeing 
significant interest from large VCs. This would 
give them access to a larger pool of capital to fund

Phable is raising $17 mn (~INR 125 Cr) in equity led by Kalaari ($7 Mn) and Aflac Ventures ($5 Mn) with 
participation from Omron and Manipal Hospitals with infusion . The company currently has ~INR 20 Cr in cash and

facility is split into two tranches of INR 10 Cr (T1) and INR 25 Cr (T2). T1 will be disbursed pre-equity infusion while 
T2 will be disbursed along with the $17 Mn equity infusion.  
 
 
Quality Founders and Experienced Team 
Both founders have experience across product, finance and engineering. They have worked at organisations such as 
6XPLWLVDVHFRQGWLPHHQWUHSUHQHXUZKRIRXQGHG.ULVW\·VNLWFKHQDIRRGWHFKstartup, which was later acquired by 
Cure.Fit at a premium. The founders have 10+ years of experience working at organisations such as Kantar, 
Borderless Access, Deloitte, etc. 
 
Phable has built a robust team of KMPs hiring experienced personnel from Healthcare, Consumer, IT, and Finance 
from organisations such as Apollo, Practo, $VLD+HDOWKFDUH&LVFR%\MX·V$VLDQ3DLQWV etc. 
 
 
Unique Customer Acquisition Proposition 
Phable acquires users by partnering with doctors and clinics. For doctors, Phable serves as a free to use end-to-end 
clinic management platform for managing appointments, health records, tele-consultation, etc. which incentivizes 
doctors to adopt the platform. The doctors can monitor their patients through the Phable app by monitoring their 
progress, vitals, past health records, etc. while the patients use the app to store their medical records, vitals 
monitoring (through IoT connected medical devices). 
 
This helps in tapping into a large pool of chronic disease patients and drive engagement. By creating a By focusing on 
doctor adoption, the company has seen a strong network effect which can be seen in the consistent decrease in CAC 
from ~INR 240 per user to ~INR 40 per user.  
 
 
 
Large TAM and Sticky Customer Base 
India has the highest incidence of chronic diseases globally with 400 million Indians suffering from hypertension and 
diabetes. Consequently, 70% of all healthcare spend of $100B (INR 7.5 lakh Cr) in India is on chronic disease care. 
Chronic diseases require higher spend on specialised medication, devices for monitoring and disease management 
programs. By being the first healthcare platform to focus on CDM, Phable is in a strong position to create a strong 
digital healthcare network for these patients. The company has already created a strong network of providers across 
devices, insurance, medicines, etc. which would enable them to capture a large wallet share from these customers. 
The company has also shown a consistent increase in daily and weekly active users (~43k and ~30.9k respectively) 
and high retention of patients acquired through doctors (63% retention in users acquires 12 months ago).

Furthermore, the company is building products for doctors and clinics, in addition to patients, who are already on the 
platform and has over 4,000 active doctors using Phable already. 
 
Reference Checks 
 
 
Saurabh Pandey, CEO and Co-founder, Akna Medical (Now Pharmeasy) 
´Chronic care is a very sticky segment and traditionally, the supply chain for medicines, quality lab tests and doctors has been 
found missing in India. There are multiple new age digital solutions that have been built in this space over the last 4-5 years and 
it was only a matter of time before a digital healthcare platform was born connecting the entire ecosystem. At Pharmeasy as well, 
we will look towards this segment through means of organic or inorganic expansion but Phable currently stands to obtain a first-
mover advantageµ 
 
Ramesh Kannan, Partner, Somerset Indus Healthcare Fund  
´7HOHPHGLFLQHRQDVWDQGDORQHEDVLVLVQRWSURILWDEOHDQGPD\QRWEHRQDVWHDG\VWDWHEDVLVHLWKHUThe only profitable segments 
can be surgery and Lab tests (Diagnostics). Chronic care management systems in India are currently broken in India and hence, 
a connected health system can go a long way to solving the problem of disconnection between a doctor and a chronic patient.Due 
to a raise in ticket sizes and the risk at hand (life), such a digital model has a good chance of showing profitability in the steady 
stateµ
